NIH Poster Day Presentation

For work, I analyzed whether a popular facial recognition machine learning algorithm showed racial or gender biases in performance. My project was presented at the NIH Company-wide Annual Poster Day.

My analysis revealed that there were racial biases in the eye and mouth region of the face detected by the machine learning algorithm. Further summary of my project can be read in the Discussion section of my poster below.
