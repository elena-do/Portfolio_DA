NIH Poster Day Presentation

For work, I analyzed whether a popular facial recognition machine learning algorithm showed racial or gender biases in performance. My project was presented at the NIH Company-wide Annual Poster Day.

My analysis showed that there were racial biases in the eye and mouth region of the face detected by the machine learning algorithm.
